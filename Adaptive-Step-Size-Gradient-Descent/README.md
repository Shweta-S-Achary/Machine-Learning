# Adaptive-Step-Size-in-Gradient-Descent

This programs implements adatptive step size in gradient descent algorithm for least square loss and hinge loss.

Run the least_square_adaptive_eta.py and hinge_adaptive_eta.py files individually by passing data and labels file as parameters.

Then you can obtain the average test error of least squares and hinge on the dataset. For this we use the avg_test_error perl
script avg_test_error.pl and the perl script error.pl
